  }

  http {
      include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
      default_type application/octet-stream;
      access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log combined;
      sendfile on;
      tcp_nopush on;
      tcp_nodelay on;
      keepalive_timeout 65;
      types_hash_max_size 2048;

      # Set the maximum allowed file size for uploads
      client_max_body_size 10M;

      server {
          listen 80;
          server_name domain.local;

          location / {
              proxy_pass http://wordpress:80;
