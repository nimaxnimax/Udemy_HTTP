pid /run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log combined;
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;

    # Set the maximum allowed file size for uploads
    client_max_body_size 10M;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name domain.local;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://wordpress:80;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
